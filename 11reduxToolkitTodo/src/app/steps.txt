1. configure store using resux toolkit 
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

then we'll assign configureStore to a variable which we are gonna export
this configureStore store will take an object but it is still not ready to use


after this we'llc create reducers
-in this we'll import createSlice & nanoid(this will generate unique id's)
-then we'll initialize One variable called "initialState" with one array called todo in this array we are having onr basic object having id & text properties.
- then we are assigning "createSlice" to a vaiable which variable we are gonna exporting. this "createSlice" takes property called name & initialState 3rd property is reducers
